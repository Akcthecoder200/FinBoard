# FinBoard - Finance Dashboard

A customizable finance dashboard built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and Recharts.

## ✅ Step 1: Project Setup - COMPLETED
## ✅ Step 2: Dashboard Layout - COMPLETED

### What we accomplished:

1. **Next.js Project Initialization**
   - Created Next.js 15.5.2 project with TypeScript
   - Configured with App Router and `src/` directory
   - Set up proper import aliases (`@/*`)

2. **Dependencies Installed**
   - Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
   - Redux Toolkit and React-Redux for state management
   - Recharts for future chart widgets

3. **Project Structure Created**
   ```
   src/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── globals.css        # Tailwind + theme variables
   │   ├── layout.tsx         # Root layout with providers

   - Complete color palette for dashboard UI

6. **Development Environment**
